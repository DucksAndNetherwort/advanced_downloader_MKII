This is how you can get started, provided you've loaded this documentation in Obsidian.

First off, you'll want to go through the [[installation canvas.canvas|installation canvas]](need to add once it's made), or read written [[installation]] guide.

Then, once you have everything installed, you can work through the [[usage from source canvas.canvas|usage from source canvas]],
or if you feel more like reading a more standard file, you can go through [[usage]].

If you want to know more about how this whole thing works, you can consult [[adl2.py]] or [[core]].
