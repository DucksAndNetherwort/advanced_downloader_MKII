I've spent quite some time on this project, starting with the comparatively awful [advenced_downloader](http://ducksnetherwort.ddns.net/gitea/DucksAndNetherwort/advanced_downloader), and eventually starting on this version, advanced_downloader_mkII, with the goal of writing far better code for it, and making it usable/maintainable. I also structured it so I could write other frontends using the same core to make intercompatible playlists.
